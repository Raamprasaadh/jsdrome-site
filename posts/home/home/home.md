# What is jsDrome?

&nbsp;

This is my personal website / technical blog. Some time in 2018, I wanted to create the perfect web boilerplate project. So I started creating a template from scratch with everything configured. All I need to do is change some configurables and a full fledged web is ready in minutes with an enterprise standard pipeline.

For the tech savvy, its a progressive web app, rendered server side, with a nodejs backend, deployed in firebase, optimised for performance, optimised for search engines, payment gateway integrated, continous integration and continous deployment integrated, with unit testing, cross browser testing in browserstack, integration testing in Cypress, Puppeteer and what not? And I used it to create my personal website. Every bit of it is built using scratch using open source software. This was the birth of **jsDrome**.
